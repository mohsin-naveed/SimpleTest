# PROJECT NAME - TextABCSort

## Acceptance Test

as a text reader
* For a given Text paragraph, I want to read through the paragraph where the words in the paragraph has been reordered and formatted as follows
    *	Results should be ordered Alphabetically First,  (Abba before Zebra)
    *	Results should be ordered from upper case to lower case but point 1 takes preference. (Abba before aBba)
    *   Remove all (.,;') chars to make it easier to read.
    *	Do not remove duplicate words
* so that I can easily scan though the words  alphabetically

## Notes
* if needed additional unit tests may be added
* insure you are happy with the project structure
* take into account we may want to swap console logger with event logger in future
* although this is a simple test, please complete the code as you would for a production release
